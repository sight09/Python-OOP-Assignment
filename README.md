# Python OOP Assignment

## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class 
- Create a class representing a real-world object (e.g., Smartphone, Book, Superhero).  
- Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life.  
- Use a **constructor (`__init__`)** to initialize unique values for each object.  
- Implement **inheritance** and demonstrate **encapsulation** (e.g., private attributes with getters/setters).  

### Example: Smartphone Class
- Attributes: brand, model, storage, battery.  
- Methods: charge(), use(), get_battery().  
- Demonstrates **encapsulation** by making battery a private attribute.  
- Inherits from a base `Device` class.

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge 
- Create multiple classes (e.g., Car, Plane, Boat) with the same action (`move()`).
- Each class defines `move()` differently to show **polymorphism**.  

### Example:
- `Car.move()` → `"Driving 🚗"`  
- `Plane.move()` → `"Flying ✈️"`  
- `Boat.move()` → `"Sailing 🚤"`

## Outcomes 
By completing this assignment, you will:  
- Understand **class design** with attributes, methods, and constructors.  
- Apply **inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism** in Python.  
- Build flexible and reusable code that models real-world objects.
